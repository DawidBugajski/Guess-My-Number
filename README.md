# Guess the number

Game created while watching a course on udemy The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

# How it works?

According to the rules, upon entering the site, a number from 1 to 20 is drawn at random, hiding under the "?" sign. The player must guess this value by entering the corresponding numbers in the designated box. Then, if the player did not make a good guess, he gets a hint whether his shot was higher or lower than the covered number. If he guesses he gets the message that he managed to win.

The player has 20 lives, if he exhausts them, he gets a message that he loses. If the player tries to check the score without entering anything in the box, he gets a message that he has to enter a number. Moreover, after winning the game, the player gets his best score. In the example, the player guessed the score on the 5th try, so the score was 15, because the initial 20 lives minus 5 gives 15. If on the next try he guesses on the second try, the highscore will update to 18

# What have I learned in this project?

On this project I was able to practice interacting with the DOM

# What made me most of the problems?

The biggest problem was focusing on refractoring my code which I specifically wrote so that it would repeat itself.

# A few words from me

The idea was taken from the course, while I focused on performing it myself, after my "Tip Calculator" project this one was relatively simple, but after following the steps making sure everything worked, I enjoyed watching and learning what the presenter had to share. In addition, I gently tweaked the game to display well on mobile devices, as the course focuses very much on JavaScript itself, so RWD is not crucial here
